# Classification-using-Keras


# Summary of Steps:

Data preprocessing including categorical encoding and normalization.

Model defined using Keras with sequential layers: Dense, ReLU, and Sigmoid.

Training performed with binary cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer.

Performance evaluated using accuracy and validation loss.

Final Result:

Final training accuracy: ~87.5%

Validation accuracy: ~86.3%

Loss curves indicate a stable model with minor overfitting.
